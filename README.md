This project implements a simple 2 layer Neural Network from scratch.

To run first clone the project to a repository.
Then create a python virtual environment: you can use "python3.12 -m venv venv".
Open the virtual evnironment: you can use "source venv/bin/activate" on mac or linux.
Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to download the requirements.
Run the file "python neural_network.py" and wait for the output.
